Hi, I'm 18Angzarr. I love the ‚çº (angzarr) Unicode symbol, which means absolutely nothing. I'm also Cypriot, and sympathetic to the ideas of Cypriotism and Hellenoturkism - DESPITE me believing that agriculture is bad. Cypriotism/Hellenoturkism are more my practical beliefs.

This is my personal README, where I'll put whatever I care enough to.
